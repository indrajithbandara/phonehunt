    <h2>Oneplus 3 Review is here!</h3>
    <p>
    I have purchased the Oneplus 3 about 2 months ago and here is my review.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Oneplus 3 lured me into buying him with it's astounding 400$ price tag. Before Oneplus came into the phone market, 
    there was a visible shortage of affordable phones with good specs. But that has now changed.
    </p>
    With it's Snapdragon 820, 6GB of RAM, 3000 mAh battery that gets charged up to 60% in 30 mins, there's not much 
    you are missing in this phone if you don't have a twice as expensive one. The performance is buttery-smooth, no hiccups whatsoever, 
    the screen, even though it has (just) a resolution of 1080p, is absolutely gorgeous, thanks to it's AMOLED panel.
    The camera is also very snappy and takes excellent photos in good light but struggles a bit in more difficult conditions.
    <p>
      In conclusion, I am very happy with my acquisition and I totally recommend you getting this phone aswell
      if you want to have a near stock-like experience for a very good price.
