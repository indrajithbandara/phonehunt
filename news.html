    <h2>Google has just launched it's new flagship... the Pixel!</h3>
    <p>
    Last week the Google Pixel made it's world stage debut, turning a lot of heads because of it's
    top of the line specs. But unfortunately, that's not all there is to it.
    </p>
    <p>
    Everybody was extremely hyped for the Pixel until we heard the price... It will be available at launch
    for about 650 US Dollars. That's very pricey for a line of phones that it is making it's debut but we will
    have to wait and see if it'll be worth the big splash of cash.
    </p>
    <p>
    That's all for now folks, hang tight, we are currently hunting for the Pixel and hope to review it as soon
    as possible. Cya!

    <h2>Oneplus 3T officially announced!</h3>
    <p>
    Today Oneplus has officially unveiled a new phone, which is an iteration of the previous flagship, Oneplus3.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Oneplus 3T brings to the table a new chipset, the Snapdragon 821, which has a slightly higher clockspeed, 
    and improved battery life. Also, the new member of the Oneplus family packs a bigger 3400 mAh battery, 
    and a whopping 16mp front-facing camera.
    </p>
    <p>
    Even though the phone comes with just a 40$ US Dollars price bump from the previous model, the fans of the Chinese
    company are not so happy, but it remains to be seen if this move will pay out for Oneplus. Have a good day!
